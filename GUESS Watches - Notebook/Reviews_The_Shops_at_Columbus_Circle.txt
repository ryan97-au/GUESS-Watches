__label__4 Great Location: Great spot for shopping and dining. Really liked the fact that it was right near Central Park. Plenty of food options in the food court below as well.
__label__4 Great location!: Great place to stop for a coffee and a wander. Fabulous location near Central Park. And an even more fabulous Wholefoods in the basement!
__label__4 Great place to get out of the rain: We had tickets to My Fair Lady and had some time to kill so stopped in. Some high end shops and restaurants. We had drinks at the Ascent Lounge. Good place to unwind with great views of the park.
__label__5 Fantastic views over Central Park: Whether or not you are into serious shopping this is a delightful building, with fantastic views over Central Park. You are treated in the lobby by two huge, anatomically correct, dark bronze statues. It must be considered lucky to touch them since particular areas are highly polished. As for shopping there is something for everyone, although if you travel on a budget you may need to 'push the boat out'.
__label__5 Great Place: Great place to shop! Cute stores and restaurants and Whole Foods downstairs! Right outside the park!
__label__5 Nice Shopping Mall: I'm a Spanish teacher and I meet with my students in some of the buildings around Columbus Circle. And I like to go to shopping sometimes to this mall. It's a nice shopping center.
__label__5 Great Array of a Shopping: The three level shopping in beautiful setting has something for everyone. Most Stores tend to be on the high end, but not ultra designer and even has an H & M. Very Clean and enjoyable.
__label__5 Great Shopping Center: This is a nicely designed shopping center. There are many high-end stores (Amazon, Coach, Eileen Fisher, William Sonoma and many more). There are some delicious dining opportunities and a large Wholefoods Market on the basement floor. During the holiday season the place is very creatively decorated.
__label__4 Nice surprise: We found this place because it is opposite the Big Bus bus-stop, where you change from the blue line (uptown) to their green line (Harlem). In need of a toilet break, they directed us in the shopping centre. Not only did we find clean toilets, but also a great spot on the first floor, where we had a delicious breakfast, overlooking Central Park. As a bonus, there was a Christmas market on the Square, which was really different and interesting - and had the most wonderful hot apple cider with chewy ginger cookies! A good place to start or finish exploring Central Park.
__label__4 High End Mall is Nice To Browse, or Glam Pit Stop: Nice place to duck in out of the rain, heat or cold, to wander around. Williams Somoma, Eileen Fisher, Coach, L’Occitane, etc and so on are in here. Bathrooms upstairs. I love all the glass in the front, and the beautiful goddess statue. This indoor mall is usually abuzz with many people/ shoppers, conveniently located near-ish transportation. Most shops are very expensive, but nice to browse anyway.
__label__4 Holiday Market Across from Shops at Columbus Circle in Central Park: Another group of pop-up shops for the holidays on the edge of Central Park. Interesting variety of shops and goods. After visiting Union Square, Bryant Park, and Grand Central, we started to get the feeling of near-deja vu. It seemed like the prices were a tad high, but not as stuffy as Grand Central. It might have been a bit more appealing if the web-spinning sales lady would have stopped trying to get my wife to spend $300 on some "youth-rejuvenating" creams to reduce her 72 years of well-earned and proudly worn wrinkles. I could have been more amused if it wasn't so cold and the woman wasn't so damned determined to pull the pile of $100's out of our pockets. But the hot chocolate was good at another shop. Still, worth a visit. Just avoid the wrinkle witchery.
__label__5 Nice place to check out: They have a large Whole Foods in the lower level and a HUGE Williams Sonoma store. They have other clothing stores and a Sephora. It's a beautiful mall and basically next to Central Park. And, during the holidays, they have a bunch of little shops nearby like they have at Bryant Park.
__label__3 nothing exciting: I guess i am not really a shopper. Nothing too exciting and over priced as well. Found it was a real tourist trap.
__label__5 Nice Place to Get Out of the Cold: There’s really nothing to not like about the Shops at Columbus Circle. They’re conveniently located across from Central Park, have a variety of shops at ALL price points, eats and drinks are also available. You can even bring your dog in and shop with them! When it’s cold out, this is the perfect place to wander and warm up.
__label__3 Another pricey shopping mall: Not as nice as the WTC Westfields or wandering down fifth avenue. Worth a look if you need a place to eat or are looking for upscale shops.
__label__4 Upscale Mall: Light and bright inside, has a good selection of stores and eateries. A nice break from the busy city.
__label__5 Come into the calm: Stepping into this mall at Columbus Circle is a very relaxing and calming change from the rest of nyc. It is also very bright and beautiful and welcoming. The stores are a good combination together. I will shop here whenever I can. Great destination for shopping.
__label__5 Joy and ste: Recommend a visit to the whole food market at Columbus circle it's a great place to look around the food choice is awesome specially if you want to have a picnic in central park it's a great to grab some treats to take with you loved the bagels you are spoilt for choice and the muffins wow great value the bagels were a dollar each well worth it and the muffins were 2dollars 50cent each delicious well worth a visit.
__label__4 Cool Spot: Stop in and have a look at things you never dreamed you needed. Clean a unique selection of shops and choices.
__label__5 Yes its high end: At the southwest corner of Central Park, a block away from the Lincoln Centre and across the street from my favorite Hotel. Equinox Fitness (came with a hotel pass) and an Amazon Store (wow - check it out). Unique pieces from jeweler Monica Rich Kosann, haircare from Aveda, cool notepads from Moleskin and Ted Baker were recent visits. You have high end restaurants - 2 of the top 10 (best) most expensive restaurants are here, two others are across the street. 26 seat Masa, an elegantly designed Japanese restaurant. It has no menu so that you may have 2 hours having an unparalleled omakase experience. The best seats are those at the bar, where you can watch Masa at work. Price: $595 prix-fixe. Per Se, an expertly designed menus change daily and reflect the freshest seasonal ingredients. Price: $325 tasting menu ($215-325 at lunch). Reasonably priced Breakfast at Bouchon Bakery, Monofuku and a few other more affordable restaurants. At least work through and experience the Center.
