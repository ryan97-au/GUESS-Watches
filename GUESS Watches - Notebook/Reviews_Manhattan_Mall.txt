__label__3 Multilevel urban mall.: This large busy mall is located near the Penn Station. Dominated by JCPenney offers variety of stores, cafes and attractions. Multiple levels and entrances.
__label__2 No thanks: This place Would not return to, their selection of stores is minimal. There were several out of business, the bathrooms were filthy. Save yourself the grief and just go to Macys.
__label__4 super location, wide range of shopping venues: I found this to be a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle on the streets outside. The Lenscrafters shop was just what I needed and they fixed my glasses at no charge. There are lots of things to enjoy here and we will definitely come back. It is located at the south end of Times Square so the location could not be any better. Harold Square is nearby. Lots of restaurants and sight seeing are available.
__label__4 Great location: Good variety of stores. There was an amazing store on the second floor with really cheap dresses but I heard they were closing. It's a clean and nice environment and has a lot of potential if there were better stores. I'm often disappointed though and wish people would see the cheaper stores on the second floor.
__label__4 Lots of Good Shops: If you are looking for a collection of shops in Manhattan then this is the place. Toy's R Us used to be in here as well as JC Penney.
__label__4 Could be awesome: Great location. It seemed a bit dated, with some updates and possibly some food vendors could be awesome.
__label__3 Disappointing: Disappointing Jc penny is the main store and that looked like a jumble sale, uninspiring shopping centre.
__label__4 nice place in the center of town: the main shop in this mall is j.c.penny store, there is rest room inside the mall and in the j.c.penny store. and there is entrence from the subway.
__label__2 Not Worth It: Nothing of worth at all to even call it a Mall, unless you are after JC Penny. So I suggest to not waste your time going there. Unless you are walking nearby check it out, that doesn't take much time.
__label__2 This isn't a mall - don't be fooled by the name: This isn't really a mall. There is a pretty decent JCPenny's in the lower levels and then a tiny handful of rather uninspiring shops at ground level and above. No real eateries, aside from a Starbucks in a cart, and no benches to sit in the public areas. If you're looking to grab something to drink or eat go to Macy's on the other side of 34th Street.
__label__3 Is this really a Mall?: Visited the so called Manhattan Mall one afternoon in July. Started out at the bottom/subway level with JC Penny and worked our way up. Being from Canada it was nice to see Aeropostale again. Not the greatest shopping experience ever, but worth a short visit. It would help to add some ambiance of a traditional shopping mall For example a few more eatery’s and some benches would go along way.
__label__2 Needs A Makeover: This place is in need of a serious makeover. Old and rundown are two good adjectives to describe this Mall. the only good store there was JC Penny as the selection was huge but even that store seemed jam-packed to the point that you have to squeeze through isles. Also the bathroom was one of the dirtiest I have ever seen.
__label__4 Head for J C Penney: Plenty of shops with lots of discounts. We found the best bargains for clothes in the J C Penney store.
__label__3 Okay Little Mall: I spent a few minutes in here. It is basically like any mall except happens to be in Manhattan. I think on a hot summer day or a cold and windy day it would be nice to go in here and get away from the weather for a while. I did like the central atrium looking upward, though. I wouldn’t go out of my way to visit here but if you are walking by it is fine.
__label__3 Needs updating: Doesn’t look like it sounds and is in need of an urgent refurbishment. Not really worth visiting- give it a miss!
__label__3 Decent Mall: Many stores in this mall centrally located in Herald Square. Great place to walk around and grab a pretzel.
__label__3 Disappointed: Manhattan Mall is located in the heart of the busy shopping area but offers a very small variety of stores. The largest store is JC Penny. The mall has a Starbucks with no tables/ chairs to sit, simply grab the coffee and go. All in all a disappointing place, not the mall one would expect in such prime location!
__label__3 Nothing special: I was expecting it to be full of stores. I went in and had a cup of coffee and that’s it. It’s an ok place to shop clothes.
__label__2 Disappointing: Only one decent store = JC Pennys. Otherwise not much to see. The highlight of the ground floor is a Starbuck’s kiosk, wow! No seating for us non-shopping husbands. Major disappointment if you are used to “normal” malls.
__label__4 Standard shopping: This is like your mall at home except it is in the middle of NYC. You will find most normal mall stores here and a huge JCPenney. Convenient to transportation.
