__label__4 Walk the Brooklyn Bridge then get show tickets at TKTS South Street: After crossing the Brooklyn bridge back to Manhattan I walked about 400 meters to the TKTS, about 12am on a Tuesday, at the TKTS South Street Seaport, near the Foulton street metro stops. A queue of only 3 people unlike the long queues at Broadway (and open from 11am a full 4 hours before broadway. Had a coffee in one of the local numerous bars and pubs and eateries.
__label__3 Shops: This area is comprised of old buildings done up. There are a number of buildings with various shops and restaurants. Some quirky shops, some fairly mainstream shops. Nice views of the East River and Brooklyn.
__label__2 Character Deficiency: It’s been a few years but when I have guests from out of town, I always try to visit the area. Well, the old Seaport is gone, and in its place is what looks like a bland office building. Gone are the quirky, touristy shops and restaurants. We walked through and the only thing with lights on the pier was a small store (sodas, magazines). The friendly security guard told us nothing else was open (it was Friday at 7 PM) and there weren’t even public restrooms available. I read that storm damage closed down many businesses and they’re opening a rooftop bar soon. The entire neighborhood was quiet though (only a few bars and shops). What a disappointment! You can still get a great view of the East River and Brooklyn Bridge, but I wouldn’t go out of your way unless you’re in the area already.
__label__5 TKTS Booth is a hidden gem!: I arrived an hour early for opening on a Tuesday; was first in line. Got tickets to two shows: one show that evening, and a matinee the next day. Not busy or crowded. Only 20 or so people in line when the ticket office opened. I will definitely use this booth on future visits to NYC.
__label__5 Great: Different perspective of city life. plenty to see and do just not as fast paced. Take some time and enjoy where you are.
__label__5 Great place for musical deals: The TKTS booth in the South Street Seaport is the best part of this district for me. You can get so many discounts, and on basically everything broadway show that is currently on broadway. Also, very cute neighborhood with lots of good restaurants.
__label__4 Seaport: The South Street seaport is still a great place to take in the sites. The waterfront area is being updated with the rooftop area at Pier 17 wiry new bars, restaurants and a skating rink. The historic area has cobblestone streets lined with upscale galleries, shops, restaurants and bars.
__label__5 NYC with the grandkids: The Seaport is always a fun place to visit. The sailing ships & Circle liner right there if you want to go out on NY Harbour. Also, many great restaurants & shops.
__label__5 Highly recommend: This is the place to be. Quiet, quaint, trendy! Stay at Mr C Seaport and visit the great bars and galleries. Love this place.
__label__4 Nice place: This area of the lower Manhattan was where we concluded our walking tour of the Area and there is lots to see and do, from the tall ship , to the seaport museum, there is also a wide range of restaurants and bars, well worth taking a look when in lower manhattan.
__label__5 Calm relaxing place: We visited here for the afternoon and it was nice to go somewhere calm and relaxing and a bit more laid back. It was nice to be down by the water and get a fab view of Brooklyn Bridge. Had a nice spot of lunch at Clinton Hall and a relaxing wander. It was not as Christmassy as I would have expected but still really nice.
__label__3 What have they done to Pier 17???: OK it’s been a while since I was last in NYC but having looked forward to visiting Pier 17 again, I was shocked to see it had been replaced by a very modern building. They have done some nice things with the outside space and it would have been nicer if more of the food and drink outlets were open but it used to have a great collection of shops which are gone and for me, the place has completely lost its charm. A little bit of New York history lost.
__label__4 Historic and changing: We stayed at Brooklyn for a while. On a sunny morning we took a water taxi and we landed in Lower Manhattan. We walked in the cobbled streets of Seaport District. Interesting area on the East River, fascinating views of the Brooklyn Bridge and NYC skyline. We crossed the historic commercial hub. We ate at a food truck near Schermerhorn Row Block, a typical red brick neighborhood. Then we moved to the Waterfront, a dynamic area under constant transformation for a drink by the river. Enjoying the day.
__label__3 Construction: Great historical area that has still not been revitalized but shows much promise. Need to add housing and shops but great view.
__label__1 This place has nothing happening.: The entire village, once teeming with activity is a ghost town. Surprising for NYC. There is a lot of construction. It is very unwelcoming. Wait a few years to see what they make of it.
__label__3 Nice ships, everything else is under construction: Lots of potential. We visited the museum and went on some of the old ships. Our schooner tour was cancelled due to weather. Loved seeing the ships and the small museum. There were some great views of the bridges. That said, food is hard to find and almost everything is under construction. They are building at least two shopping centers and what looked like some apartments. There were a few food carts and one higher end restaurant that was closed. No mid-range dining I could find. There was a small market with excellent chocolate chip cookies, which held the kids off long enough to see the ships.
__label__2 Closed: I was sad to see it closed for renovations as it has always been a favorite place of mine in the past because it is just outside the hustle and bustle of the city, yet you are still able to see the beautiful buildings and have a bite to eat on the water. Check to see if it is re-opened yet before you go.
__label__2 Nothing to see or do: Unfortunately the seaport area is still under construction. Hopefully over the next few months Pier 17 will be finished and restaurants and stores will open. There are few options for food or shopping at this time.
__label__4 Ship: The area has nice streets to walk .There shops and restaurants within walking distance. This is a good place to walk about with friends.
__label__2 Deserted: I had been so looking forward to re-visiting the Seaport as we had such a great time there a few years ago. So we were VERY disappointed to find big parts of it closed for refurbishment. There had been no mention of this on their website and we had made the subway trip from midtown especially.
